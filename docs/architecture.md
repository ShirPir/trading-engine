# Algorithmic Trading Platform Architecture

This document explores the platform's architecture, highlighting its modular design for efficient development and future expansion.

**Modular Components:**

* **Data Acquisition:**
   - Fetches market data from various sources (broker APIs, financial data providers, etc.).
   - Parses data formats and stores retrieved information in a structured manner (e.g., `data/`).

* **Strategy Development:**
   - Core strategy logic resides in `src/algorithmic_trading/`.
   - The `strategy.py` script defines the trading logic based on your chosen technical indicators or other signals.
   - Strategy parameters are configured in `configs/strategy_config.yaml` for maintainability and experimentation.

* **Backtesting:**
   - Simulates your strategy's performance on historical data and evaluates its effectiveness.
   - Backtesting frameworks (e.g., `Zipline`, `Backtrader`) may be used for advanced testing scenarios.
   - Performance metrics (Sharpe Ratio, drawdown, win rate) guide optimization efforts.

* **Order Management (Optional):**
   - Handles order placement, modification, and cancellation with your chosen broker.
   - Integrates with your broker's API (consider using existing libraries for specific brokers).
   - Implements basic order types (market, limit) and potentially more advanced types based on your needs.

* **Risk Management (Optional):**
   - Integrates risk management strategies to limit potential
