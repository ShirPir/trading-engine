Algorithmic Trading Platform

This repository contains the source code for a Python-based algorithmic trading platform designed for development, backtesting, and potentially deploying trading strategies in a modular and organized manner. The platform prioritizes code maintainability, testability, and best practices to provide a solid foundation for algorithmic trading exploration.

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Basic understanding of Python programming
Familiarity with algorithmic trading concepts (optional)

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python installations on your system:
Bash
python -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Activate virtual environment (Windows)
Använd koden med försiktighet.

Explore the Codebase:

Refer to the docs/architecture.md file for an in-depth overview of the platform's architecture.
The core application logic resides in the well-organized src/algorithmic_trading/ folder, promoting modularity and reusability.
Unit and integration tests within the tests/ folder ensure code quality and functionality.
Developing Your Strategy:

Study the example strategy provided in src/algorithmic_trading/strategy.py to understand the core structure and logic.
Modify the strategy logic based on your chosen trading approach, incorporating technical indicators, fundamental analysis elements, or other signals as needed.
Refer to configs/strategy_config.yaml for strategy-specific configuration options, allowing you to easily adjust parameters without modifying the core code.
Backtesting:

The platform currently emphasizes backtesting functionalities, enabling you to rigorously evaluate your strategy's performance on historical market data stored in the data/historical/ folder. You can incorporate various data sources or formats to suit your testing needs.
The backtesting logic might reside within src/algorithmic_trading/ or a separate module, depending on your project structure and preferences.
Backtesting should generate performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio, drawdown, and win rate to assess your strategy's effectiveness, identify potential weaknesses, and guide optimization efforts.
Deployment (Optional - Future Enhancements):

While this repository primarily focuses on local development and backtesting, the deployments/ folder lays the groundwork for potential containerized deployment with Docker in the future. This would enable easier scaling and distribution of your algorithmic trading application.
