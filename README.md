# Algorithmic Trading Platform

This repository contains the source code for a Python-based algorithmic trading platform designed for development, rigorous backtesting, and potential deployment of trading strategies. The platform prioritizes:

- **Modular Design:** Enhances code maintainability, reusability, and scalability.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit and integration tests ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Configuration Management:** Enables easy adjustment of parameters without modifying core code.
- **Best Practices:** Follows industry best practices for secure and reliable algorithmic trading.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Basic understanding of Python programming
   - Familiarity with algorithmic trading concepts (optional)

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone [https://github.com/your-username/algorithmic_trading_app.git](https://github.com/your-username/algorithmic_trading_app.git)
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd algorithmic_trading_app
     ```
   - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
     ```
   - Install project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Explore the Codebase:**
   - Refer to `docs/architecture.md` for an in-depth overview.
   - Core logic resides in `src/algorithmic_trading/`, promoting modularity and reusability.
   - Unit and integration tests are located in `tests/`.

4. **Developing Your Strategy:**
   - Study the example strategy in `src/algorithmic_trading/strategy.py` for structure and logic.
   - Adapt the strategy based on your chosen approach (technical indicators, fundamental analysis, etc.).
   - Adjust parameters in `configs/strategy_config.yaml` without modifying core code.

5. **Backtesting:**
   - Focus on backtesting using historical market data stored in `data/historical/` (modify for your data storage).
   - The backtesting logic might reside within `src/algorithmic_trading/` or a separate module.
   - Backtesting should generate performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio, drawdown, and win rate.

**Deployment (Future Enhancement):**

- While focused on local development and backtesting, `deployments/` lays the groundwork for potential containerized deployment with Docker, enabling easier scaling and distribution.
